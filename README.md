The rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has introduced new opportunities to improve agricultural practices. One of the major challenges faced by farmers today is the timely detection and diagnosis of crop diseases. This mini-project focuses on developing an AI system that uses image processing techniques to analyze leaf images, identify diseases, and provide recommendations for remedies. By assisting farmers in identifying crop issues early, this system aims to improve crop yield, reduce financial losses, and promote sustainable farming practices![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d243d5f8-bb37-4132-9f84-5a6fa30b5543)
